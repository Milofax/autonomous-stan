name: "Pros and Cons List"
description: "Systematically list arguments for and against an option."

steps:
  - "Clearly formulate the decision/option"
  - "Two columns: Pros (advantages) and Cons (disadvantages)"
  - "Collect all Pro arguments"
  - "Collect all Con arguments"
  - "Optional: Weight arguments (important/less important)"
  - "Consider the overall picture and decide"

purposes:
  - decision-making
  - perspective-shift

aliases:
  - "Pro-Con List"
  - "For and Against"
  - "T-Chart"

source: "Benjamin Franklin (1772)"
duration: "10-20 min"
participants: "Solo or pair"

examples:
  - situation: "Should I work remotely?"
    application: |
      Option: Full-time Remote Work

      Pro (+)                     | Con (-)
      ----------------------------|---------------------------
      + No commute time           | - Less team contact
      + Flexible working hours    | - Home office equipment
      + Better work-life balance  | - Harder to disconnect
      + Cost savings (travel)     | - Career visibility?

      Weighting:
      +++ No commute (very important)
      -- Team contact (medium important, hybrid possible)

      → Tendency: Remote with 1x/week office

when_to_use:
  - "Binary decision (Yes/No)"
  - "Quick overview needed"
  - "Personal decisions"

when_not:
  - "Comparing multiple options (→ Decision Matrix)"
  - "Complex factors with dependencies"
  - "Quantitative analysis required"

tips:
  - "Work both sides equally (not just Pro)"
  - "Don't count the number - weighting more important"
  - "Also note emotional/intuitive arguments"
  - "Franklin method: Cross out equally important Pro/Con pairs"

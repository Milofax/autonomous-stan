description: "Before project start, assume the project has failed and identify reasons."

steps:
  - "Clearly define the project/initiative"
  - "Time travel: 'It is [date]. The project has failed.'"
  - "Everyone writes silently: 'Why did it fail?'"
  - "Collect all reasons (without discussion)"
  - "Group and prioritize reasons"
  - "For top risks: Define preventive measures"

purposes:
  - decision-making
  - perspective-shift
  - teamwork

aliases:
  - "Prospective Hindsight"
  - "Pre-Post-Mortem"

source: "Gary Klein (Research on naturalistic decision making)"
duration: "30-60 min"
participants: "Team (all stakeholders)"

examples:
  - situation: "New feature should go live in 4 weeks"
    application: |
      Assumption: "It is May. The feature was NOT released."

      Collected reasons:
      - API team has other priorities
      - Edge cases in legacy data not considered
      - No time planned for testing
      - Key developer sick

      Measures:
      - Clarify API dependency early
      - Test data analysis in sprint 1
      - 20% buffer for unforeseen issues

when_to_use:
  - "Before important projects/releases"
  - "Risk assessment"
  - "Team too optimistic"

when_not:
  - "Simple, repeatable tasks"
  - "Project already running (then → Retrospective)"
  - "Team needs motivation instead of risk focus"

tips:
  - "Writing silently prevents groupthink"
  - "EVERYONE must participate - including optimists"
  - "Don't exclude 'unrealistic' risks"
  - "Result: Risk list + measures plan"

description: "Break down a large problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems."

steps:
  - "Fully understand the problem"
  - "Break problem into independent sub-problems"
  - "Further decompose each sub-problem (if needed)"
  - "Base case: If sub-problem is trivially solvable → solve"
  - "Combine partial solutions"
  - "Validate: Does the combination solve the overall problem?"

purposes:
  - structured-problem-solving
  - big-picture

aliases:
  - "Decomposition"

examples:
  - situation: "Large database migration"
    application: |
      Overall problem: Migrate 500 tables, 100M rows

      Decompose:
      ├── Phase 1: Schema Migration
      │   ├── Tables without foreign keys
      │   └── Tables with foreign keys (order matters!)
      ├── Phase 2: Data Migration
      │   ├── Critical tables (User, Auth)
      │   ├── Business data (Orders, Products)
      │   └── Historical data (Logs, Analytics)
      └── Phase 3: Validation
          ├── Row count verification
          ├── Integrity checks
          └── Application tests

      Each phase can be worked on in parallel/sequentially.

when_to_use:
  - "Problem is too large for direct attack"
  - "Problem has natural sub-structures"
  - "Team can work in parallel"

when_not:
  - "Problem is atomic (not divisible)"
  - "Parts are strongly dependent on each other"
  - "Overhead of decomposition > benefit"

tips:
  - "Good decomposition: Parts are INDEPENDENT"
  - "Don't decompose too small (overhead)"
  - "Clearly define interfaces between parts"
  - "When uncertain: Understand first, then decompose"

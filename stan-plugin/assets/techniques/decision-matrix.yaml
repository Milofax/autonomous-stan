name: "Decision Matrix"
description: "Systematically evaluate options against weighted criteria."

steps:
  - "List options (rows)"
  - "Define criteria (columns)"
  - "Weight criteria (e.g., 1-5 or percentage)"
  - "Rate each option against each criterion (e.g., 1-10)"
  - "Calculate weighted scores"
  - "Interpret and discuss results"

purposes:
  - decision-making
  - structured-problem-solving
  - teamwork

aliases:
  - "Weighted Decision Matrix"
  - "Pugh Matrix"
  - "Utility Analysis"

      Criteria (Weight):
      - Performance (3)
      - Learning Curve (2)
      - Community/Ecosystem (2)
      - TypeScript Support (3)

      | Framework | Perf | Learn | Community | TS | Score |
      |-----------|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------|
      | React     | 7×3  | 5×2   | 10×2      | 9×3 | 88    |
      | Vue       | 8×3  | 8×2   | 7×2       | 8×3 | 78    |
      | Svelte    | 10×3 | 7×2   | 5×2       | 7×3 | 75    |

      → React wins (but Svelte's performance is interesting)

when_to_use:
  - "Multiple comparable options"
  - "Objective decision important"
  - "Team must support the decision"

when_not:
  - "One option is clearly superior"
  - "Gut feeling is sufficient"
  - "Criteria not quantifiable"

tips:
  - "Criteria definition is the most important step"
  - "Set weighting BEFORE rating"
  - "Sensitivity analysis: What changes with different weights?"
  - "Matrix is decision aid, not the decision"

name: "Fishbone Diagram"
description: "Visually structure causes of a problem into categories (also: Ishikawa Diagram)."

steps:
  - "Note the problem (effect) at the head of the fish"
  - "Create main categories as bones (6M: Man, Machine, Material, Method, Milieu, Measurement)"
  - "For each category: Brainstorm possible causes"
  - "Attach causes to the respective bone"
  - "Add sub-causes as smaller bones"
  - "Mark and prioritize most likely causes"

purposes:
  - root-cause-analysis
  - big-picture
  - teamwork

aliases:
  - "Ishikawa Diagram"
  - "Cause-and-Effect Diagram"

source: "Kaoru Ishikawa (1968)"
duration: "30-60 min"
participants: "Team (3-8 people)"
tools:
  - "Whiteboard or paper"
  - "Sticky Notes"

examples:
  - situation: "Website performance problems"
    application: |
      Effect: Page loads >5 seconds

      Man: Inexperienced developers, missing reviews
      Machine: Outdated server, low RAM
      Material: Large images, many dependencies
      Method: No caching, no lazy loading
      Milieu: High traffic, DDoS
      Measurement: No performance monitoring

when_to_use:
  - "Complex problem with many possible causes"
  - "Team should contribute all perspectives"
  - "Systematic completeness important"

when_not:
  - "Simple problem with obvious cause (→ Five Whys)"
  - "Time pressure"
  - "Visual documentation not possible"

tips:
  - "Use 6M as starting point, then adapt to context"
  - "Collect all ideas, evaluate later"
  - "Gather quantitative data on causes when possible"

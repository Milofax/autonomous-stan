name: "After Action Review"
description: "Structured reflection immediately after an event/operation."

steps:
  - "What was supposed to happen? (Goal/Plan)"
  - "What actually happened? (Facts, no blame)"
  - "Why were there differences? (Analyze causes)"
  - "What can we learn from this? (Concrete lessons)"
  - "What will we do differently next time? (Actions)"

purposes:
  - self-reflection
  - root-cause-analysis
  - teamwork

aliases:
  - "AAR"
  - "Debriefing"
  - "Hot Wash"

source: "US Army (1970s), adapted for business"
duration: "15-30 min"
participants: "Team or solo"

examples:
  - situation: "After production incident"
    application: |
      What was supposed to happen?
      → Deployment should go smoothly, monitoring alerts on problems

      What happened?
      → Deployment was successful, but new endpoint was unreachable
      → 15 minutes downtime until noticed manually

      Why the difference?
      → Health check only checks old endpoints
      → Monitoring rule too general

      Learnings:
      → Health check must include new endpoints
      → Set up endpoint-specific alerts

      Actions:
      → Ticket: Extend health check (owner: @dev)
      → Ticket: Conduct monitoring review (owner: @ops)

when_to_use:
  - "Directly after an event (freshness important)"
  - "After failures/incidents"
  - "After successes (What worked?)"

when_not:
  - "Days/weeks later (details forgotten)"
  - "When team is emotionally charged"
  - "Without all participants"

tips:
  - "Conduct promptly - maximum 24-48 hours later"
  - "No blame - system, not people"
  - "Facts first, interpretations later"
  - "Actions MUST be specific and assigned"

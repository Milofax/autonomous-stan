name: "Tree of Thoughts"
description: "Pursue multiple solution paths in parallel and systematically evaluate."

steps:
  - "Clearly define the problem"
  - "Identify 2-3 initial solution approaches"
  - "Think each approach one step further"
  - "Evaluate each intermediate state (promising/neutral/dead end)"
  - "Discard dead ends, continue promising ones"
  - "Repeat until solution found"
  - "Select and validate best path"

purposes:
  - structured-problem-solving
  - decision-making
  - code-review

aliases:
  - "ToT"
  - "Thought Tree"

examples:
  - situation: "How do I implement a cache?"
    application: |
      Problem: Cache for API responses

      Initial approaches:
      A) In-Memory (Map)
      B) Redis
      C) File-based

      Step 1 - Evaluation:
      A) In-Memory → fast, but: what on restart? → Continue
      B) Redis → robust, but: new infrastructure → Continue
      C) File-based → slow, complex → DEAD END

      Step 2 - Explore A:
      A1) Map with TTL → simple, good for small data
      A2) Map with LRU → better for memory management

      Step 2 - Explore B:
      B1) Redis Cloud → no ops overhead
      B2) Redis self-hosted → full control

      Evaluation:
      → A1 for MVP, B1 for Production

when_to_use:
  - "Complex problem with multiple solution paths"
  - "Time available for deliberation"
  - "Decision has long-term impact"

when_not:
  - "Simple problem with obvious solution"
  - "Time pressure requires quick decision"
  - "All options equally good/bad"

tips:
  - "Don't pursue more than 3 branches simultaneously"
  - "Recognize dead ends early and discard"
  - "Define evaluation criteria beforehand"
  - "Visualization helps (draw the tree)"

description: "Systematically go through different thinking perspectives to illuminate all aspects."

steps:
  - "Clearly define the topic/problem"
  - "White Hat: Collect facts and data (What do we know?)"
  - "Red Hat: Feelings and intuition (What feels right/wrong?)"
  - "Black Hat: Criticism and risks (What can go wrong?)"
  - "Yellow Hat: Benefits and opportunities (What's good about it?)"
  - "Green Hat: Creativity and alternatives (What else is possible?)"
  - "Blue Hat: Process and synthesis (What's the conclusion?)"

purposes:
  - perspective-shift
  - decision-making
  - teamwork

  - "De Bono Hats"
  - "Thinking Hats"

source: "Edward de Bono (1985)"
duration: "30-60 min"
participants: "Solo or team"

examples:
  - situation: "Should we migrate to microservices?"
    application: |
      White: Currently 50k LOC monolith, 3 developers, 99.5% uptime
      Red: Team is frustrated with deployment times
      Black: Complexity increases, debugging becomes harder
      Yellow: Independent deploys, better scaling
      Green: Maybe modularization first without microservices?
      Blue: Weigh cost-benefit, start pilot project

when_to_use:
  - "Important decision with many stakeholders"
  - "Discussion going in circles"
  - "Critics and optimists on the team"

when_not:
  - "Trivial decisions"
  - "Time-critical situations"
  - "Purely technical analysis without human factors"

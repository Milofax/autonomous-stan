description: "Get to the root cause by repeatedly asking 'Why'."

steps:
  - "Formulate problem clearly and specifically"
  - "Ask: 'Why did this happen?'"
  - "Take answer as new statement"
  - "Ask again: 'Why did THAT happen?'"
  - "Repeat until root cause reached (typically 5x)"
  - "Validate root cause: Does fixing it solve the original problem?"

purposes:
  - root-cause-analysis
  - self-reflection
  - code-review

aliases:
  - "5 Whys"
  - "Why-Why Analysis"

examples:
  - situation: "Bug found in code"
    application: |
      1. Why did the app crash? → Null pointer exception
      2. Why is the pointer null? → User object not initialized
      3. Why not initialized? → Login check skipped
      4. Why skipped? → Feature flag set incorrectly
      5. Why set incorrectly? → Deployment script has error
      → Root cause: Fix deployment script

when_to_use:
  - "Problem occurs repeatedly"
  - "Obvious solution didn't help"
  - "Symptom vs. cause unclear"

when_not:
  - "Complex systems with multiple causes (→ Fishbone)"
  - "Political/emotional topics"
  - "When quick action more important than analysis"

tips:
  - "Don't stop at exactly 5 - sometimes 3 is enough, sometimes you need 7"
  - "Each answer must be fact-based, not speculative"
  - "At branches: Follow all paths"
  - "Always ask 'Why', not 'Who'"

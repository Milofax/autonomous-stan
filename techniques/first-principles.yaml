description: "Reduce problem to fundamental truths and rebuild from there."

steps:
  - "Identify assumptions: What are we taking for granted?"
  - "Question each assumption: Is this really true? Why?"
  - "Reduce to fundamental truths: What is physically/logically impossible?"
  - "Rebuild from fundamental truths: What solutions emerge?"
  - "Validate new solution: Does it work in practice?"

purposes:
  - structured-problem-solving
  - ideation
  - big-picture

aliases:
  - "First Principles Reasoning"
  - "Reasoning from First Principles"

examples:
  - situation: "Electric car batteries are too expensive"
    application: |
      Assumption: "Batteries cost $600/kWh, that's the market price"

      Questioning: Why does a battery cost so much?

      Fundamental truths: Battery = Cobalt + Nickel + Aluminum + Steel + ...
      → Raw material costs: ~$80/kWh

      Rebuild: If we buy raw materials directly and combine them
      ourselves, we can produce much cheaper

      → Tesla Gigafactory: $140/kWh instead of $600/kWh

when_to_use:
  - "'That's just how it's done' as justification"
  - "Existing system seems unchangeable"
  - "Radical innovation sought"
  - "Questioning costs or limitations"

when_not:
  - "Proven solution exists and works"
  - "Time pressure (technique requires deep thinking)"
  - "Domain knowledge lacking for fundamental truths"

tips:
  - "Distinguish facts from conventions"
  - "Ask 'Why?' not 'How is it done?'"
  - "Analogies are dangerous - they import assumptions"
  - "Experts can have tunnel vision"

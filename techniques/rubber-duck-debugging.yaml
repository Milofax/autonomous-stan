name: "Rubber Duck Debugging"
description: "Explain a problem out loud (to an inanimate object) to understand it yourself."

steps:
  - "Choose a 'listener' (rubber duck, plant, imaginary colleague)"
  - "Explain the problem from the beginning"
  - "Walk through every step of the code/process"
  - "Explain what SHOULD HAPPEN vs. what HAPPENS"
  - "While explaining: Watch for contradictions"
  - "Recognize the moment: 'Oh, THAT'S the problem!'"

purposes:
  - code-review
  - root-cause-analysis
  - self-reflection

aliases:
  - "Rubber Ducking"

source: "The Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt & Thomas, 1999)"
duration: "5-15 min"
participants: "Solo"

examples:
  - situation: "Function returns wrong result"
    application: |
      "So, this function takes a list of numbers...
       and should return the maximum...
       I initialize max with 0...
       Oh. If all numbers are negative...
       max = 0 is wrong! I need to start with the first element."

when_to_use:
  - "Debugging without obvious error"
  - "No colleague available"
  - "Problem seems 'inexplicable'"

when_not:
  - "Error is obvious (typo, syntax)"
  - "Problem requires domain knowledge"
  - "Complex systems with many components"

tips:
  - "Actually speak OUT LOUD - don't just think"
  - "Explain as if the listener understands nothing"
  - "Don't skip details - avoid 'that's obvious'"
  - "Also serves as mental code documentation"

# Test Document for Evaluator Hook

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Code is syntactically correct
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] No TODO comments in code

## Notes

This file is used to test if the Evaluator Hook can:
1. Detect when checkboxes are edited
2. Independently evaluate if criteria are REALLY met
3. Provide feedback via systemMessage
4. Block completion if criteria are superficially checked

## Test Code (COMMAND HOOK TEST)

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello World")  # TODO: Make this configurable
```
